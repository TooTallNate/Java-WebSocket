Java WebSockets
===============

### Note: This lib currently only supports the older draft 75 and draft 76.
###       Pull requests for the latests drafts would be more than accepted!

This repository contains a barebones WebSocket server and client implementation
written in 100% Java. The underlying classes are implemented using the Java
`ServerSocketChannel` and `SocketChannel` classes, which allows for a
non-blocking event-driven model (similar to the
[WebSocket API](http://dev.w3.org/html5/websockets/) for web browsers).

Running the Example
-------------------

There's a simple chat server and client example located in the `example`
folder. First, compile the example classes and JAR file:

``` bash
ant
```

Then, start the chat server (a `WebSocketServer` subclass):

``` bash
java -cp example:dist/WebSocket.jar ChatServer
```

Now that the server is started, we need to connect some clients. Run the
Java chat client (a `WebSocketClient` subclass):

``` bash
java -cp example:dist/WebSocket.jar ChatClient
```

The chat client is a simple Swing GUI application that allows you to send
messages to all other connected clients, and receive messages from others in a
text box.

There's also a simple HTML file chat client `chat.html`, which can be opened
by any browser. If the browser natively supports the WebSocket API, then it's
implementation will be used, otherwise it will fall back to a
[Flash-based WebSocket Implementation](http://github.com/gimite/web-socket-js).

Writing your own WebSocket Server
---------------------------------

The `net.tootallnate.websocket.WebSocketServer` abstract class implements the
server-side of the
[WebSocket Protocol](http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-socket-protocol/).
A WebSocket server by itself doesn't do anything except establish socket
connections though HTTP. After that it's up to **your** subclass to add purpose.

Writing your own WebSocket Client
---------------------------------

The `net.tootallnate.websocket.WebSocketClient` abstract class can connect to
valid WebSocket servers. The constructor expects a valid `ws://` URI to
connect to. Important events `onOpen`, `onClose`, `onMessage` and `onIOError`
get fired throughout the life of the WebSocketClient, and must be implemented
in **your** subclass.

Testing in Android Emulator
---------------------------

Please note Android Emulator has issues using `IPv6 addresses`. Executing any
socket related code (like this library) inside it will address an error

``` bash
java.net.SocketException: Bad address family
```

You have to manually disable `IPv6` by calling

``` java
java.lang.System.setProperty("java.net.preferIPv6Addresses", "false");
java.lang.System.setProperty("java.net.preferIPv4Stack", "true");
```

somewhere in your project, before instantiating the `WebSocketClient` class.
You can check if you are currently testing in the Android Emulator like this

``` java
if ("google_sdk".equals( Build.PRODUCT )) {
  // ... disable IPv6
}
```
